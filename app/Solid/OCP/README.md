### Analysis of the Poor Design in Terms of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The provided code does not adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) from SOLID design principles. Here's an analysis:

### Example Code

```php
<?php

namespace App\Solid\OCP\Bad;

class Payment
{
    public function payNow($paymentName)
    {
        if($paymentName == MomoPayment::PAYMENT_NAME){
            (new MomoPayment())->pay();
        }elseif($paymentName == VNPayPayment::PAYMENT_NAME){
            (new VNPayPayment())->pay();
        }elseif($paymentName == PaypalPayment::PAYMENT_NAME){
            (new PaypalPayment())->pay();
        }else{
            throw new \Exception("Invalid payment method");
        }
    }
}
<?php

namespace App\Solid\OCP\Bad;

class MomoPayment
{
    const PAYMENT_NAME = "MOMO";

    public function pay()
    {
        echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d", self::PAYMENT_NAME, 10);
    }
}
<?php

namespace App\Solid\OCP\Bad;

class VNPayPayment
{
    const PAYMENT_NAME = "VNPay";
    public function pay()
    {
        echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d",self::PAYMENT_NAME, 5);
    }
}
<?php

namespace App\Solid\OCP\Bad;

class PaypalPayment
{
    const PAYMENT_NAME = "Paypal";

    public function pay()
    {
        echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d", self::PAYMENT_NAME, 5);
    }
}
<?php

namespace App\Solid\OCP\Bad;

class ClientClient
{
    public function pay()
    {
        $payment = new Payment();
        $payment->payNow(MomoPayment::PAYMENT_NAME);
    }
}
```

### Poor Design Analysis

1. **Violation of Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
    - **Modification Required for New Payment Methods:** The `Payment` class is tightly coupled with specific payment methods (`MomoPayment`, `VNPayPayment`, `PaypalPayment`). If a new payment method needs to be added, you must modify the `Payment` class by adding a new `elseif` block. This violates OCP, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

2. **Scalability Issues:**
    - **Difficulty in Extending Payment Methods:** As more payment methods are introduced, the `Payment` class will become increasingly complex, making it harder to maintain. Each new payment method requires changes to the core `Payment` class, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Tight Coupling:**
    - **Direct Instantiation:** The `Payment` class directly instantiates specific payment classes, which tightly couples the `Payment` class to those implementations. This design does not allow for flexible swapping of payment methods or easy addition of new ones.

### Improved Design

To adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, you can refactor the code as follows:

1. **Define a Payment Interface:**

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Solid\OCP;

   interface PaymentMethodInterface
   {
       public function pay(): void;
   }
   ```

2. **Implement the Payment Methods:**

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Solid\OCP;

   class MomoPayment implements PaymentMethodInterface
   {
       public function pay(): void
       {
           echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d", "MOMO", 10);
       }
   }

   class VNPayPayment implements PaymentMethodInterface
   {
       public function pay(): void
       {
           echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d", "VNPay", 5);
       }
   }

   class PaypalPayment implements PaymentMethodInterface
   {
       public function pay(): void
       {
           echo sprintf("paid by %s discount %d", "Paypal", 5);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Refactor the Payment Class to Use Dependency Injection:**

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Solid\OCP;

   class Payment
   {
       private PaymentMethodInterface $paymentMethod;

       public function __construct(PaymentMethodInterface $paymentMethod)
       {
           $this->paymentMethod = $paymentMethod;
       }

       public function payNow(): void
       {
           $this->paymentMethod->pay();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Refactor the Client Class:**

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Solid\OCP;

   class ClientClient
   {
       public function pay(): void
       {
           $paymentMethod = new MomoPayment(); // Can be replaced with other payment methods easily
           $payment = new Payment($paymentMethod);
           $payment->payNow();
       }
   }
   ```

### Improved Design Benefits

- **Adherence to OCP:** The `Payment` class is now open for extension (by introducing new payment methods) but closed for modification. You donâ€™t need to change the `Payment` class to add new payment methods; just create a new implementation of `PaymentMethodInterface`.
- **Flexibility:** Payment methods are now managed through dependency injection, making it easier to swap or add new payment methods without altering existing code.
- **Decoupling:** The `Payment` class no longer directly depends on specific payment implementations, reducing tight coupling and improving maintainability.

This design ensures that your system is more adaptable to changes and extensions, aligning with the principles of SOLID.
